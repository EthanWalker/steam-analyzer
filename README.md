# Steam Analyzer

A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) based web application that uses the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) to show comparative user data.

## Motivation

After a [similar project by Lambent Stew](http://www.pcgamer.com/steam-time-analysis-tool-updated/) that I had really enjoyed disappeared I felt the need to fill that void myself.

## Dependencies

* Flask==0.11.1
* requests==2.11.1
* requests-cache==0.4.13

## Versioning

I am using [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/EthanWalker/steam-analyzer/tags).
